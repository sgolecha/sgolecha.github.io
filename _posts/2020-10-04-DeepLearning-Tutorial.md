If you have a background in ML but need a good short introduction to Deep Learning, then the following two tutorials by Quoc V.Le will not dissapoint you. These are a bit old (published sometime in 2015) but I found them very useful - they provide a good intuitive explanation (with examples) and use mathematical rigor wherever needed.

A Tutorial on Deep Learning:
* [Part 1: Nonlinear Classifiers and The Backpropagation Algorithm](/assets/docs/deeplearning-tutorial1.pdf)
* [Part 2: Autoencoders, Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks](/assets/docs/deeplearning-tutorial2.pdf)
