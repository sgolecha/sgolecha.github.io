title: 15 Important Mental Models
categories: decisionmaking
---

Recently, I started digging into mental models and how they can help in making better decisions. Although, there are some great books on this subject (e.g. [Charlie Mungers Almanac](https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Charles-Expanded/dp/1578645018/ref=sr_1_2?crid=X4NRDCLRL7HM&dchild=1&keywords=charlie+munger+poor+charlie%27s+almanack&qid=1614903921&sprefix=Charlie+Munger%2Caps%2C225&sr=8-2), [The Great Mental Models by Farnham Stree](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Mental-Models-Thinking-Concepts/dp/1999449002/ref=sr_1_1?crid=10F7A9BW0UYNF&dchild=1&keywords=farnam+street+mental+models&qid=1614903981&sprefix=Farnham+street+%2Caps%2C228&sr=8-1)), I found a post on [fs.blog](https://fs.blog) (by `speedgoat`) that listed some important models. I am posting it here because I felt that the list was short, crisp and quite useful:

- Bezos’ Razors:
	- If unsure what action to take, let your 80-year-old self make it.
	- If unsure who to work with, pick the person that has the best chances of breaking you out of a 3rd world prison.

- Skinner’s Law:
  - If procrastinating on an item, you only have 2 options:
    - Make the pain of not doing it greater than the pain of doing it.
    - Make the pleasure of doing it greater than the pleasure of not doing it.

- Luck Razor:
  - If stuck with 2 equal options, pick the one that feels like it will produce the most luck later down the line. I used this razor to go for drinks with a stranger rather than watch Netflix. In hindsight, it was the highest ROI decision I’ve ever made.

- Bragging Razor:
  - If someone brags about their success or happiness, assume it’s half what they claim.
  - If someone downplays their success or happiness, assume it’s double what they claim. The map is not the terrain.

- Hofstadter’s Law:
  - It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law. Every project costs 2x as much and takes 3x as long - even when you factor this into your projections.

- Elon’s Law:
  - If you have a project, combat Hofstader’s Law by setting a ridiculously ambitious deadline. Even if it takes 3x longer than the deadline, you’re ahead of everyone else. Elon Musk missing his superhuman deadlines is a feature rather than a bug.

- Naval’s Razors:
  - If you have 2 choices to make and it’s 50/50, take the path that’s more painful in the short term.
  - If a task is worth less than your ambitious hourly rate - outsource it, automate it or delete it.

- Munger’s Law:
  - Never allow yourself to have an opinion on a subject unless you can state the opposing argument better than the opposition can. Steelman Arguments > Strawman Arguments

- Hitchen’s Razor:
  - What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

- Newton’s Flaming Laser Sword:
  - If something can be settled by experiment or observation, then it is not worthy of debate. UFC 1 >>> Decade long debates on the best martial arts

- Joe Rogan’s Razors:
  - If unsure what action to take - ask what the hero in the movie would do.
  - If you’re intensely passionate about something and nobody around you is interested in it - assume the scale of the internet might help you find them.

- Taleb’s Surgeon:
  - If presented with two seemingly equal candidates for a role, pick the one with the least amount of charisma. The uncharismatic one has got there despite their lack of charisma. The charismatic one has got there with the aid of their charisma.

- Discomfort Razor:
  - The more uncomfortable the activity, the more likely it will lead to growth.
  - The more comfortable the activity, the more likely it will lead to stagnation. 1000 uncomfortable hours > 10,000 comfortable hours

- Checkhov’s Gun:
  - When telling a story, if it’s non-essential - don’t include it. “If you say in the 1st chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the 2nd or 3rd chapter it absolutely must go off. If it’s not going to be fired, it shouldn’t be hanging there.”

- Occam’s Razor:
  - Simple assumptions are more likely to be correct than complex assumptions.

- Avoid Occam’s Duct Tape:
  - Someone who approaches a problem with a ridiculously large number of assumptions.

- Walt Disney’s Rule:
  - If struggling to think clearly about a subject, draw it out. Here’s Walt Disney’s drawing he made in 1957 of the Media Empire he wanted to build. It’s iconic 55.

- Schwarzeneggers’ Rule:
  - Never need to monetize your artistic pursuits. You won’t have to sacrifice your inner joy and vision for a payday.
  - Arnold made millions from property and D2C bodybuilding guides so he never had to say yes to acting gigs he didn’t like.
